# This is a NetworkTables server (eg, the robot or simulator side).
#
# On a real robot, you probably would create an instance of the 
# wpilib.SmartDashboard object and use that instead -- but it's really
# just a passthru to the underlying NetworkTable object.
#
# When running, this will continue incrementing the value 'robotTime',
# and the value should be visible to networktables clients such as 
# SmartDashboard. To view using the SmartDashboard, you can launch it
# like so:
#
#     SmartDashboard.jar ip 127.0.0.1
